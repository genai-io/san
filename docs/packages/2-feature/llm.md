# llm

Provider registry, model store, and active-connection handle for every LLM
backend (Anthropic, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Google, Moonshot, Alibaba, MiniMax,
Z.ai/GLM, DeepSeek, Ollama, SenseNova, Volcengine Ark, Xiaomi MiMo, Agnes-AI,
plus a user-defined OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Reaching them is one adapter,
the `vendor_*` files, over
[`genai-io/sdk-go`](https://github.com/genai-io/sdk-go); adding a vendor is a
row in `vendor_table.go`, not a package.

## Purpose

The agent loop streams through the SDK's own client (see
[`packages/core.md`](../3-core/core.md)). This package owns *reaching an
endpoint and choosing one* — discovering providers, persisting the user's
chosen provider/model, switching between them at runtime, handing the loop the
client for a turn along with the settings that turn runs under, and tracking
cost for each call.

## Contract

`*Conn` is the handle to the active LLM: the connected Provider, the current
model, and the Store of available providers/models — all under one mutex. The
package exposes `*Conn` directly — no Service interface, no wrapper type.

```go
package llm

// Conn is the opaque handle. Type exported; fields unexported (every
// accessor is mutex-protected).
type Conn struct { /* internal fields */ }

func (c *Conn) Provider() Provider
func (c *Conn) SetProvider(p Provider)
func (c *Conn) ModelID() string
func (c *Conn) CurrentModel() *CurrentModelInfo
func (c *Conn) SetCurrentModel(info *CurrentModelInfo)
func (c *Conn) NewClient(model string, maxTokens int) *Client
func (c *Conn) Store() *Store

// Package-level access
func Initialize()
func Default() *Conn
```


## Internals

One file per subject:

```
provider.go    the contract: Provider, the types crossing it, the optional extensions
effort.go      which reasoning rung applies to a model, and cycling between them
registry.go    every provider/auth pair San can open, and its connection status
auth.go        interactive (OAuth) sign-in, as the registry sees it
conn.go        the package-level *Conn, provider resolution, the cross-vendor pool
client.go      Client: a Provider plus a model; hands the loop a per-turn *ai.Client
store.go       providers.json — what the user connected and chose
modelcache.go  the cached listings, and the context window resolved from them
cost.go        Money, the multi-currency total, and per-provider/auth pricing
logging.go     CompletionOptions, as the log package reads it
vendor*.go     every vendor, over genai-io/sdk-go
data/          the model data built into the binary (see Model data)
```

The test double lives outside the binary, in
`tests/integration/testutil.FakeProvider`.

Worth knowing beyond the names:

- **One identity string.** `providerKey(provider, auth)` builds the
  `"vendor:auth_method"` form that the registry keys entries by, the store keys
  cached listings by, and a `Provider` reports as its own `Name()`. One
  function, so the three cannot drift.
- **Classification is nobody's here.** The SDK decides, from the provider's
  typed error, and `ai.IsRetryable` / `ai.IsContextExceeded` read that decision
  wherever it is needed — including for an error no driver ever wrapped. San
  keeps no second copy of the tables and no place for a failure to arrive
  untagged.
- **`modelcache.go` owns the window.** The status bar's percentage and the
  agent's auto-compaction trigger are the same number, so both resolve it
  through `EffectiveContextWindow` — the user's `/context limit` override, then
  this provider's cache, then the largest figure cached anywhere for the ID —
  and both compact at `PromptBudget`: the window less the reply's `OutputCap`.
  Issue #338 was the two disagreeing. See `reference/token-limits.md`.
- **`ModelInfo.Reasoning`** carries live supported/default effort values when a
  provider advertises them; `effort.go` prefers that metadata and falls back to
  `ThinkingEffortProvider`, which answers from San's model data for listings
  (such as the standard OpenAI `/v1/models` response) that omit it.
- **`vendor*.go` is one adapter, not one package per vendor.** The wire
  protocols, their streaming shapes and their reasoning dialects belong to the
  SDK's drivers; what stays here is the seam — `Provider` on one side,
  `ai.Client` on the other — the table saying which San provider is which
  catalog vendor, and the model data. `vendor.go` names the file each subject lives in.

## Lifecycle

- Construction: `Initialize()` loads `~/.san/providers.json`,
  picks the last-used provider (or the first connectable one), and stores
  it.
- Switching: `/models` slash command calls `SetCurrentModel` + reload.
- Per-call: `NewClient(model, maxTokens)` produces a `*Client` for one
  inference; the client wraps `Provider.Infer`.

## Model data

The SDK's catalog says how to reach a vendor and speak its protocol — endpoint,
credential variable, wire dialect — and nothing about its models. Which models a
vendor serves, their windows, output caps, prices, input kinds and reasoning
efforts change every few weeks, so they are San's data, in layers
(`vendor_data.go`), each overriding the one before it field by field:

```
internal/llm/data/models.dev.json   models.dev, trimmed to San's vendors, built in
~/.san/cache/models.json            the same, refetched daily in the background
internal/llm/data/san.json          what models.dev lacks: per-vendor default
                                    effort and fallbacks, retired models and their
                                    replacements, a model that cannot stop reasoning
~/.san/models.json                  the user's own corrections, same shape
```

and the endpoint's live listing over all of them. The shape is models.dev's,
keyed by catalog vendor ID. `SAN_DISABLE_MODEL_REFRESH=1` skips the daily fetch;
`go test ./internal/llm -run TestModelDataSnapshot -update-model-data` refreshes
the built-in snapshot.

A few rules keep it honest:

- **Data describes; it never routes.** The trim keeps only the fields
  `modelSpec` reads — no endpoint, header or credential name survives it — and
  drops figures outside any plausible range, so a bad fetch reads as "unknown",
  not as a fact.
- **The data names reasoning efforts; the SDK spells them.** A model's ladder is
  the efforts its data names, cut to what its protocol can tell apart
  (`ai.Model.WireEfforts`), with the lineup's default marked. The wire value of
  each rung — `"none"`, `"enabled"`, `"HIGH"`, a token budget — is derived by the
  SDK from the protocol, so none of it is written here.
- **An unrecognised model reports 0**, not a guess, unless its lineup states a
  fallback. San treats 0 as "window unknown" and skips proactive compaction,
  which is recoverable; a guessed window is acted on silently and is wrong in
  both directions.
- **Cost is per way in.** An estimator is registered per provider/auth pair and
  only for metered access — a subscription or coding plan is a flat fee.

Model Studio is the exception that proves the shape: it publishes no window for
any of its hundreds of models and answers per model instead, which is what
`llm.ModelLimitsFetcher` exists for.

`ModelInfo` carries the rest of a catalog row as facts — `Lifecycle`,
`Replacement`, `TextOnly` — never as a rendering of them. Each flag is named for
the exception rather than the rule, so a listing cached by an older San decodes
as "nothing unusual" instead of as a claim.
The `/models` picker aligns the figures into columns and writes the labels
itself (`modelLabels`), because prose stored in the cache would fix the wording
in a file that outlives the release that wrote it, and because the `·` it
separates with is East Asian Ambiguous: a string measured anywhere but where it
is drawn measures wrong.
